    <p class="body-copy">In early med school, it felt like the walls were closing in.</p>
    <p class="body-copy">I could see AI getting smarter, but I was too busy memorising stuff to prepare.</p>
    <p class="body-copy">Medicine seemed overpriced, like a bunch of overachievers racing to buy houses right before the 2008 crash...</p>
    <p class="body-copy">And worst of all? I wasn't smart enough to find a way out.</p>
    <p class="body-copy">So I started learning.</p>
    <p class="body-copy">I began studying economics, and philosophy, and physics, and psychology, and business.</p>
    <p class="body-copy">I picked up ideas from Charlie Munger, Nassim Taleb, Jeff Bezos, Epictetus, Adam Smith, Naval Ravikant, Richard Feynman, and countless others.</p>
    <p class="body-copy">But I'm nowhere near finished. I'm trying to build a durable, practical set of ideas, and it'll probably take decades.</p>
    <p class="body-copy">Here, you'll find a distillation of what I learn.</p>
