              <h2 id="medentry-story">1. We'll start with the most interesting stuff first...</h2>

              <p>After scoring highly in the UCAT (Australia's MCAT), I was invited to work for <a href="https://www.medentry.edu.au/" target="_blank">MedEntry</a> as a question writer.
                I did this for 15 months, before noticing an interesting opportunity.</p>

                <p>At the time, MedEntry's newsletter was structured as a series of repackaged blog posts. Extremely useful, but not extremely engaging. So I did the following:</p>
                <br>
                <p><b>Step 1:</b> Bought a handful of copywriting books (see <a href="./reading">recommended reading</a>).</p>
                <p><b>Step 2:</b> Wrote ~100,000 words of my own newsletters based on things I was learning (the latest of which you can find <a href="https://hardwired.beehiiv.com/p/new-mountain" target="blank">here</a>). </p>
                <p><b>Step 3:</b> Took on a few free clients (<a href="https://testimonial.to/willbradley/all" target="_blank">here are their testimonials</a>).</p>
                <p><b>Step 4:</b> Wrote a few sample emails upfront, and pitched an idea to a contact at MedEntry alongside my next submission of questions.</p>
                <br>
                <p>I was given a meeting with the company's Director of Education, and he liked the idea.</p>
                <p>Since then, I've worked with MedEntry (and <a href="https://medsummit.com.au/" target="_blank">a company they invest in</a>) on a range of projects, including newsletters, VSL scripts, and email series.</p>
                <p>In the process, I'm learning how to work well in a team, write SOPs, and structure meetings (so that they're actually an efficient use of everybody's time!)</p>
                <p>I never learned any of these skills at school, so this has been incredibly valuable...</p>
                <p><b>But I also understand that a story like this is very uncommon,</b> and therefore difficult to quantify or compare with others. Which leads us to the next section:</p>

                <p>Here are mine (in rough chronological order)...</p>

                <div class="wx-details">
                <p>Over Christmas in 2022, I worked in the Deli of a local supermarket. I resigned in early 2023 to pursue other opportunities, but was asked back over Christmas of 2023-2024.
