              <h2><b>Medicine is prestigious.</b></h2>

              <p>Here in Australia, there's no Harvard that everyone wants to get into, and no NBA that'll hand you a 7-figure contract straight out of high school.</p>
              <p>Sure, we have proxies for these, but as far as I can tell, it's much more about <i>what</i> you're studying, as if it's a projection of future social status.</p>
              <p><b>So, when I tell people I'm a medical student, they immediately treat me with more respect.</b></p>
              <p>I've always found this strange, because all I had to do was perform well in some standardised tests â€” sure, it took effort, but a computer could do it, no questions asked.</p>
              <p>And although, over the last 18 months, I've continued my studies without too many problems, the dilemma is beginning to eating away at me.</p>
              <p><b>The farther I look down the conventional career path, the more uneasy I begin to feel.</b></p>
              <p>The more I teach  myself to think independently, the more I'm struggling to put up with the inefficiencies of the typical trajectory.</p>
              <p>Of course, job security is important, and you've gotta be able to provide value to the marketplace in order to survive, but does that really have to involve decades of standardised testing and specialisation?</p>
              <p>I have no idea.</p>
              <p>So I'm writing this in an attempt to compile advice I've received from different mentors, in the hopes of building a plan that's solid enough to work towards.</p>
              <p><b>What you're about to read is the result of years of constant worrying and stressing over a single problem.</b></p>
              <p>Very painful to write, but I hope you find it valuable to read.</p>
              <p>And we start with the central question: what do you want?</p>
              <p>This is a difficult one, and can never truly be answered, but I think it's something approximating "autonomy".</p>
              <p><b>Which begs the question: how do you get autonomy?</b></p>
              <p>In our world, the most practical answer is you have enough resources to survive, even while taking into account unexpected shocks to the system.</p>
              <p>You can do this in a couple of ways:</p>
              <p>1. Make enough money so you'll never need to work again.</p>        
              <p>2. Learn to live on zero.</p>
              <p>3. Build a life that enables you to earn money while doing things that compound in a positive direction in the long run.</p>
              <p>I think the answer lies somewhere in the middle, which gives us our first  principle...</p>
              <p style="font-size: 2em"><b>Principle 1: Spend As Little Money As Possible (Especially On Useless Stuff).</b></p>
              <p>The more money you have lying around in cash and liquid assets like index funds, the more time you have to play with. When you have 3 years of expenses sitting in the bank, you become much harder to manipulate.</p>
              <p>The more I research, the more it seems like - beyond a level of basic needs - most other frivolous spending yields very little return. Even experientially, this rings true.</p>
              <p><b>But it doesn't answer the question: what is the correct approach to <i>making</i> money?</b></p>
              <p>Let's look at it through the lens of a doctor:</p>
              <p>Imagine you're an intern, the lowest doctor on the totem pole. You work in the hospital, and are trying to decide your next career move.</p>
              <p>On one hand, you could take the next 6-10 years to specialise. This involves a series of standardised assessments and hoops to jump through. At the end of the pathway, however, your income increases dramatically.</p>
              <p>In theory, this income gives you a massive increase in autonomy, but it's not so simple...</p>
              <p>Think about it: <b>the more you specialise in <i>anything,</i> the more dependent you become on other people and systems. By definition, this has to be true.</b></p>
              <p>Sure, a brain surgeon can make more money than a junior doctor, but only if they work as a brain surgeon. The skills of a specialist doctor aren't particularly transferrable outside of a very narrow domain.</p>
              <p>Yes, there's additional credibility that could be transferrable outside the medical field, but the return on each incremental investment of time start dropping off after the initial qualification.</P>
              <p>The conclusion?</p>
              <p><b>Many high earning careers (especially the conventionally admired ones) will give you an above-average income in exchange for your autonomy and your time.</b></p>
              <p>In the hopes of becoming independent, you sacrifice your independence, with the only real net gain being the income that comes with it.</p>
              <p>Which leads us to our second principle:</p>
              <p style="font-size: 2em"><b>Principle 2: If you can't leave a high-paying job, you aren't independent.</b></p>
              <p>Seems obvious when you say it, doesn't it?</p>
              <p>A doctor, or a lawyer, or a dentist all have prestigious jobs. But they spend their careers gaining skills that aren't transferrable outside their areas - the cost of leaving continues to rise, and their independence continues to fall.</p>
              <p>You could make the argument that there are certain soft skills that you pick up on in these careers, and I agree, but - like with credibility - the returns become very diminishing very quickly.</p>
              <p>This is an excellent incentive structure if you're the employer, but not so great for everyone else.</p>
              <p>So what's the alternative? If your true goal is autonomy, how do you make enough money to get there without backing yourself into a corner?</p>
              <p>You need a way of being taken seriously by the market, without sacrificing everything in the process...</p>
              <p>Which led me to form this next idea.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 2em"><b>Principle 3: Embrace Compounding, But Avoid Commoditisation.</b></p>
              <p>When you get to the peak of a high-paying career, it's very difficult to leave.</p>
              <p>Why? Because in the process of accumulating non-transferrable skills and increasing your income, you've sacrificed the compounding of your knowledge.</p>
              <p>You lose autonomy when you continually sacrifice transferrable learning for earning.</p>
              <p>But, at the same time, if you only learn and never earn, you also have no autonomy.</p>
              <p>As a result, our current criteria is as follows: you want to learn skills that are (a) transferrable, so you don't get trapped, (b) valuable to the marketplace, so you can make money as you learn, and (c) compound on top of one another to create unique combinations, which are difficult to replicate, thus avoiding commoditisation.</p>
