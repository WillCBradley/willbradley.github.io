        <p><b>I've always sought autonomy.</b></p>
        <p>But it's taken a long time to define what this means.</p>
        <p>You're autonomous when the only restrictions placed on you come from:</p>

        <p>(1) Physics</p>
        <p>(2) A non-tyrannical legal system</p>
        <p>(3) Constraints adopted by choice (not necessity)</p>

        <p>You achieve this by having enough resources to meet your needs, or lowering your needs to accomodate your resources.</p>
        <p>But for the average Joe with a wife, a dog, and 2.2 kids, becoming a monk isn't exactly an option. So we're left with option A â€” obtain enough resources.</p>
        <p>Which leads us to another problem: </p>
        <p>Many conventional paths to wealth come at the cost of autonomy, even if they're lucrative.</p>
        <p>We can easily be locked into decades-long ruts by past decisions, especially when our reputations are at stake.</p>
        <p>As we <a href="./specialist">specialise</a>, our world-views narrow, and we become more likely to lose contact with reality.</p>
        <!--Add G vs S link when ready-->
        <p>This is extremely dangerous.</p>
        <p>When you can't see the world clearly, you'll take instructions from someone who can.</p>
        <p>Mix in some questionable incentive structures, and you've got yourself a recipe for dependence.</p>
        <p>But it's not a matter of complete self-reliance, either.</p>
        <p>Some specialisation is required, and without division of labour, we'd be back to the stone age.</p>
        <p>After all, I'm typing this on a computer I didn't design, using software I didn't build, protected by laws I've never had to enforce or revise.</p>
        <p>Instead, it's about understanding things at a macro level, <i>and then specialising based on that knowledge.</i></p>
        <p>This gives us three core components of an autonomous person:</p>

        <p>(1) Be fiercely autodidactic</p>
        <p>(2) Maintain constant contact with reality/free markets</p>
        <p>(3) Value morality over freedom, and freedom over status</p>

        <p>It's not complete, but it's the best I've come up with so far.</p>
